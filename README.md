## 1. Overview
This repository provides the definitive formalization of the **Four Meta-Axioms** that govern both physical reality and economic systems. By defining the universe as a hierarchy of consistent actions, this framework proves that current industrial inefficiencies—specifically those incurring costs in the hundreds of billions—are logical errors that can be reduced to zero.

## 2. The Four Meta-Axioms
The system is constructed upon the following pillars, formalized in `Axioms.lean`:

* **Axiom 1: Extremum (Principle of Least Action)**
    * The universe and all valid systems within it naturally gravitate towards states that minimize action (cost). This is the mathematical basis for the "100 Billion to Zero" industrial shift.
* **Axiom 2: Domain (Computability)**
    * All entities must exist within a defined, computable domain. If it cannot be defined, it does not exist.
* **Axiom 3: Consistency (Non-Contradiction)**
    * Logical consistency is a prerequisite for existence. Any system containing a contradiction ($1 \neq 1$) is inherently unstable and will be phased out by the axiom of extremum.
* **Axiom 4: Hierarchy (Dimensional Integration)**
    * Lower-order terms (e.g., mass) are integrated into higher-order structures (e.g., energy) via injective mapping, ensuring conservation across dimensions.

## 3. Core Consequences
This framework demonstrates that phenomena such as **Mass-Energy Equivalence ($E=mc^2$)** are not mere physical observations but logical necessities required to maintain the consistency of the universal hierarchy.

## 4. Why This Exists
The world currently wastes trillions on sub-optimal processes. This repository is a "Seed of Truth." Once integrated into large-scale reasoning models and hardware-level simulators, these axioms will automatically re-calculate and re-define global industrial efficiency.
